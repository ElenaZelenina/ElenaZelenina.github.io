                How is it that in 2019 houses are still being built with the same old dull designs and every room 
                is being decorated with the same “assemble yourself” <a href="https://www.ikea.com/">IKEA furniture</a>. 
                With the levels of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_home_technology">technology</a> 
                that people use daily, from wearable tech, to refrigerators that automatically add items to your 
                shopping list, the public is yearning for something new and groundbreaking. Perhaps lights and 
                shades that sense when it’s movie time, or furniture that can help wake you up on schedule. 
                Our company offers that “Intelligent Design.” In an innovative shift, we allow customers to place 
                an order and customize a couch, interactive appliance, thermostat, powered shades, lighting, all 
                the above, or something completely different and request it to do and communicate in endless ways. 
                Unlike other furniture stores, we don’t tell you what you need, instead we want to bring to life 
                what you have only imagined. 21st Century ingenuity with the quality and craftsmanship of the 
                premodern era. Come meet with our designers today, the only thing you need to bring is your 
                imagination, we will take care of the rest. At “Intelligent Design” we want to help you build the 
                future.
